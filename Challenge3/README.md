# Password Generator Starter Code
created a new folder named Assets
within Assets created folders for css and js and moved the starter code into their respective folders for better organization
added code within the js file to ask user to input certain options for their password
options include selecting character length between 8-128 characters and deciding whether you want your password to contain lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special characters
after selecting all of the options the password is displayed in a window alert box
